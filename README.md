### Problem Statment
build a multiple machine learning classification model that predicts whether a credit card application will be approved or not based on the given applicant and application features.

### Dataset description
We are using a credit card approval dataset.
It has 690 intances and 16 features, target variable Approved (Approval status) - 0 or 1
Target variable is binary and distribution ~ 0.445

It contains a mix of demographic, financial, employment, and credit-related attributes used to predict whether an application will be approved. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features, making it suitable for evaluating multiple machine learning classification algorithms.
